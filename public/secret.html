<h1>No Fragment, Rich Views</h1>
<h5>Android Development at HomeAway part 2</h5>

<p>
Alright, let's jump back into this topic where we left off. If you haven't read <a href="/#/blog/1">Part 1</a> make sure you do that. So where did we leave off, oh yea, handling UI interaction.
</p>

<h3>Handling UI element interaction</h3>
<p>So we now have our quote view that beautifully displays our Quote objects in a wonderfully contained way. But we can't be happy just displaying data, we want to interact with it. Perhaps we want to add a button that says "Show Tax Information" that in one Activity takes you to full screen tax breakdown, but in another Activity shows you a popup with minimal tax information. Where should this logic live? </p>

<p>
If I was using a Fragment here are two popular choices: I could either handle the logic for the button click in the Fragment directly like so
</p>
<pre>
public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup viewGroup, Bundle bundle) {
  View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.some_view, viewGroup, false);
  view.findViewById(R.id.some_button).setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
    public void onClick(View v) {
      //do this when we click the button,
      handleButtonClick();
    }
  })
}
//overwrite me if you want different behavior
protected void handleButtonClick() {}
</pre>

<p>or I could have the Fragment implement some sort of Listener pattern so an outside component can handle it. </p>
<pre>
public class SomeFragment extends Fragment{

  public static interface SomeFragmentListener {
    public void pleaseHandleThisClickForMe();
  }

  private SomeFragmentListener mListener;

  public void setListener(SomeFragment listener){...}

  public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup viewGroup, Bundle bundle) {
    View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.some_view, viewGroup, false);
    view.findViewById(R.id.some_button).setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
      public void onClick(View v) {
        if(mListener != null) {
          mListener.pleaseHandleThisClickForMe();
        }
      }
    })
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Both of these choices seem fairly confining to me. With the first option, I handle the click right in the Fragment; but what if I wanted different behavior? Better get out the subclasses! A subclass just for that? I'll pass. Now the second option is a bit more extensible, but filled with boiler plate. You have to make a listener for each Fragment! Be sure to null out that listener on the appropriate lifecycle method as well, wouldn't want that sticking around on rotation, especially if your listener is an Activity<p>

<p>I think that we should have the best of both worlds; an easy way to provide a default implementation, and an easy way to overwrite it when we need it to. With rich views this behavior is very easy to implement, all we have to do is change the click listener when we want to overwrite the button's behavior, and ButterKnife makes this extremely easy. ButterKnife allows us to define click listeners on any function using an annotation, and assign the click listener simply by calling inject. So let's provide a default implementation that would take us to a new full screen Activity<p>

<pre>
public class PaymentBreakdownView extends FrameLayout {
  //omitted constructors that call init

  private void init() {
    //grab a layout inflater, and inflate R.layout.view_quote, into this FrameLayout
    LayoutInflater.from(getContext())
                  .inflate(R.layout.view_payment_breakdown, this, true);
    ButterKnife.inject(this);
  }

  @OnClick(R.id.some_button)
  public void showTaxInformation(){
    Intent someIntent = TaxInfoActivity.getIntent(mPaymentSchedule);
    getContext().startActivity(intent);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>That part's pretty easy, ButterKnife wires up the click listener to our showTaxInformation() method simply by annotating the method with the @OnClick annotation. So now what do we do if our Activity wants to show a minimal display popup instead of taking you to a full screen activity? We simply provide another method in our Activity with the same annotation</p>

<pre>
public class ShowPopupActivity extends Activity {
  @InjectView(R.id.payment_schedule)
  PaymentBreakdownView mPaymentBreakView;

  public void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_show_popup);
    ButterKnife.inject(this);
  }

  @OnClick(R.id.some_button)
  public void showTaxInformationPopup() {
    //show some popup here
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Now our showTaxInformationPopup() method will get called instead of the view's implementation, but how did that work? Under the hood we're simply assigning the OnClickListener of some_button to the Activity last. When we call setContentView(), our PaymentBreakdownView will be constructed, have its init() called, and assign PaymentBreakdownView.showTaxInformation() as the click listener for some_button, but then when execution returns to ShowPopupActivity, it assigns itself as the clicklistener with ButterKnife.inject. It simply works as if you had a normal view hierarchy and were assigning an OnClickListener with ButterKnife, nothing special required. Our UI code is now extremely portable, and flexible in the places where you need to occasionally provide special actions without tons of boiler plate!</p>


<p>The state management section started to get fairly long, so you'll have to wait for part 3</p>
